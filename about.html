						<p>
							My name is Anthony Daniel. I'm from Rivers, NIgeria living in Lagos. 
						</p>
						<p>I am a ui/ux and product deigner. Initially i started my journey in software as a web designer (html,css,javascript).
							But then i realised i had a flare for design so i went into graphics, mastering (photoshop). And again graphics design
							turned out not to be what i really wanted to do so i started learning mobile Application Development using flutter. Two years later i came across 
							ui-ux design which i dived into without hesitation and since then till date, ui-ux turned out to be my one true love.
